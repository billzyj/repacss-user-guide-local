Use this page to identify and resolve common issues encountered on REPACSS.

---

## Job Not Starting

- Check if your job is pending due to resource availability:
  
  ```bash
  squeue --me
  ```

- Look for the **NODELIST(REASON)** column for hints like:
  - `Resources`: Not enough nodes available.
  - `Priority`: Waiting for higher-priority jobs to clear.
  - `Dependency`: Job depends on another that hasn’t finished.

---

## Invalid Account or Partition

If you see:
```
sbatch: error: Job request does not match any supported policy.
```

- Ensure your account/project is valid and available for the selected partition.
- Set your account using:

  ```bash
  #SBATCH --account=m1234
  ```

---

## Python Module Not Found

If you get:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
```

- Check that you’ve activated the correct conda environment:
  ```bash
  conda activate myenv
  ```

- If it’s missing, reinstall it:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  ```

---

## SSH Connection Issues

- If login is slow or stuck:
  - Try verbose output to debug:
    ```bash
    ssh -vvv your_username@repacss.ttu.edu
    ```

- Make sure VPN is connected properly.

---

## "command not found"

If a common command like `gcc`, `python`, or `nvcc` fails:
- Check if the required module is loaded:
  ```bash
  module list
  module load gcc/12.2.0
  ```

---

## Poor Performance

- Check if you’re using correct compiler flags and parallel settings.
- Use profiling tools like:
  ```bash
  time ./a.out
  perf stat ./a.out
  ```

- Review CPU or GPU utilization via `sstat` or `jobstats`.

---

## Disk Quota or Storage Issues

If you see:
```
Disk quota exceeded
```

- Use `du -sh *` to identify large files.
- Remove or move unnecessary data.

---

## Data Transfer Fails

- If `scp` or `rsync` fails:
  - Double-check path and permissions.
  - For large transfers, consider:
    ```bash
    rsync -avzP source/ user@repacss.ttu.edu:/destination/
    ```

---

## Infinite Loop or Hanging Job

- Make sure loops have valid exit conditions.
- Add logging or print statements to verify execution flow.
- You can cancel the job with:
  ```bash
  scancel <jobid>
  ```

---

## Module Conflicts

- If loading a module breaks something:
  ```bash
  module purge
  module load only_what_you_need
  ```

---

## Need Help?

If all else fails:

- Reach out to your advisor or system admin.
- Provide job ID, error message, and the job script when asking for help.
