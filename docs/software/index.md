# Software Management on REPACSS

This section covers all aspects of software management on REPACSS, organized by package management approach and use case.

## ðŸŽ¯ Software Management Categories

### 1. **HPC Applications & System Software** â†’ Spack + Module System
For HPC applications, compilers, libraries, and system-level software managed through Spack and loaded via the Lmod environment module system.

**Start here:** [Module System](module-system.md)

### 2. **Data Science Applications** â†’ Conda/MiniForge
For Python/R-based data science, machine learning, and scientific computing packages using MiniForge (conda) environments. This includes applications like Jupyter Notebook for interactive development.

**Start here:** [Getting Started with MiniForge](miniforge.md)

### 3. **User Self-Installed Software** â†’ Custom Solutions
For software not available through the above methods, users can install their own software using:

#### 3.1 **Containers (Apptainer)** â†’ Pre-built Binaries
For pre-built applications, complex software stacks, and reproducible environments.

**Start here:** [Using Containers](containers.md)

#### 3.2 **Building from Source** â†’ Custom Compilation
For software that needs to be compiled from source code with specific configurations.

**Start here:** [Building from Source](building-from-source.md)

#### 3.3 **Trending AI Applications** â†’ Specialized AI Tools
For popular AI applications that use containers for deployment.

**Start here:** [Running Ollama](running-ollama.md)
