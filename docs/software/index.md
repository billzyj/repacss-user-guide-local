# Software Management on REPACSS

This section covers all aspects of software management on REPACSS, organized by package management approach and use case.

## ðŸŽ¯ Software Management Categories

### 1. **HPC Applications & System Software** â†’ Spack + Module System
**System-provided software** - Users simply load what they need.

For HPC applications, compilers, libraries, and system-level software managed through Spack and loaded via the Lmod environment module system. **No installation required** - just load the modules you need.

**Start here:** [Module System](module-system.md)

### 2. **Data Science Applications** â†’ Conda/MiniForge
**User-installed software** - Users install locally, then add packages.

For Python/R-based data science, machine learning, and scientific computing packages using MiniForge (conda) environments. **Requires local installation** of MiniForge, then install packages like [Jupyter Notebook](jupyter-notebook.md) for interactive development.

**Start here:** [Getting Started with MiniForge](miniforge.md)

### 3. **User Self-Installed Software** â†’ Custom Solutions
**User-installed software** - Users install their own software using:

#### 3.1 **Containers (Apptainer)** â†’ Pre-built Binaries
For pre-built applications, complex software stacks, and reproducible environments. Examples include [Ollama](running-ollama.md) for AI applications.

**Start here:** [Using Containers](containers.md)

#### 3.2 **Building from Source** â†’ Custom Compilation
For software that needs to be compiled from source code with specific configurations.

**Start here:** [Building from Source](building-from-source.md)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **HPC applications?** Check available modules: `module avail` (system-provided)
2. **Data science work?** Set up MiniForge: See [Getting Started with MiniForge](miniforge.md) (user-installed)
3. **Custom software?** Choose containers or source build based on your needs (user-installed)
4. **Want popular applications?** See commonly used software: [Popular User Applications](#popular-user-applications)
